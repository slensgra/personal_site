How do we start this out?
Or rather what is the goal of the article?
It is basically a report of the project -- ie here is what we did and why we did what we did
but it is free of the constraints of a conference format. Or rather, it is an explanation of the results that is free to be long and include nonacademic stuff
it should still be pretty short though


I guess the main difference is that it will include some engineering rationale behind things. What is the structure then?
* We provide an overview of the system, noting how simple it is.

It's challenging to divide things up along the system lines because everything is linked.
I don't have the experiment timeline recorded very well so that would be hard to recreate


* we could divide it down into the main subsystems:
    1. localization
    2. Manipulator / block design
    3. Control / thrusters


Robot hardware platform
    What is an interesting enough structure for one of these sections?

    things that didn't work:
        * blue robotics h264 webcam
        * tethered operation
        * no kill switch
        * no ui
        * raspberry provide


Localization / Control
    things that worked:
        * the current control architecture (custom FCU firmware, new FCU)
