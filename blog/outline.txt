How do we start this out?
Or rather what is the goal of the article?
It is basically a report of the project -- ie here is what we did and why we did what we did
but it is free of the constraints of a conference format. Or rather, it is an explanation of the results that is free to be long and include nonacademic stuff
it should still be pretty short though


I guess the main difference is that it will include some engineering rationale behind things. What is the structure then?
* We provide an overview of the system, noting how simple it is.

* we could divide it down into the main subsystems:
    1. localization
    2. Manipulator / block design
    3. Control / thrusters
